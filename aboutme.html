                    <p>
                        Hello and welcome! I'm Mutombi, a junior data scientist with a passion about all things predictive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>A bit about my work history to date...</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, I started of my career in engineering after completing my Masters degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Sheffield. My first graduate role was an electrical engineer for Romax Technology in the Electrification Systems and Controls
                        department, where I supported the functional testing, measurement and calibration of a multispeed transmission e-powertrain development programme, as well as working on internal modelling methods and processes in order to boost
                        company capability, efficiency and IP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A year or so later, I transitioned to their parent company where I was responsible for developing multi-body dynamic models for a novel aerospace e-actuation system and developing actuator selection tools to streamline the preliminary design stage within
                        the system engineering framework. Although the work was interesting, I was keen to follow my interest in pursuing data science as a career so at the beginning of 2022, I made the transition to work for a non-for-profit medical
                        indemnity provider called Medical Protection Society, where I have been responsible for deploying predictive models, presenting to executives on market analysis, gaining web-scraping experience as well as restructure databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>My career goals...</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With data science being a broad field itself, my interests cover a wide range of topics including
                        <a href="engineering_landing.html">optimisation</a>, <a href="ml_landing.html">machine learning</a> and <a href="webscraping_landing.html">data engineering</a>. With the learning journey being long in any career path transition,
                        I've found the best way to learn is by doing which is the founding reason for my portfolio. <b>My long term career goal is open up opportunities for others by utiltising data science.</b> This applies to both commerical and hopefully
                        more of a social setting, where I think data science is an accessable skill for anyone with a laptop and some curiosity can gain.
                    </p>
