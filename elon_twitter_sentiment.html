                        <h1>Elon's Twitter Sentiment</h1>

                    <p>
                        I personally like Elon Musk. With his take over of twitter, I asked myself the question,
                        <b>what is the public's general opinion of Elon and how does this sentiment correlate to Telsa's stock price?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll use Twitter gauge public sentiment and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to measure the consensus from a sample of 20,000 daily tweets extracted from Twitter. The sentiment metrics we'll use are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Polarity</b>, which measures the directionality of the sentiment i.e. if the content of the tweet is positive, negative or neutral. This is measured from [-1,1].</li>
                            <li><b>Subjectivity</b> measures the extent of the subjectivity or objectivity in the tweet. We can think of this as a proxy for the level of emotions or opinions expressed on a scale of [0,1].</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll also gather NASDAQ market data to have an initial look at the if the movement of the Telsa shares changes with Elon Musk's public sentiment. But first we'll write a function to extract the tweets <i>(see github for complete code)</i>:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
						<code>
def daily_tweets( n_daily_tweets:int = 100 , t_days:int = 30 , query:str = '' , username:str = '@elonmusk') -> DataFrame:
    '''
    Returns a dataframe of at most n daily tweets for a given query for a specified period of time starting today.

    Parameters
    ------------
    t_days (int): The number of days prior to today for which you want to extract tweets.
    n_daily_tweets (int): The number of tweets to extract each day.
    query (str): The hastag or tweet you want to tweet about.
    '''

    for day_n in range(t_days):
        #moving time period
        start_day = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=day_n+1)
        start_day = start_day.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        end_day = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=day_n)
        end_day = end_day.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        
        #get data
        df_day = search_tweets(
                                query = '"{}"'.format(query), 
                                since=start_day, 
                                until=end_day, 
                                exclude_retweets=True, 
                                exclude_replies=False, 
                                max_tweets=n_daily_tweets ,
                                lang='en' ,
                                username=username
                            )

        #make date a column not index
        df_day.reset_index(inplace=True)

        # append to single df
        if day_n == 0:
            df = df_day.copy()
        else:
            df = pd.concat([df , df_day] , ignore_index=True)

    return df
						</code>
					</pre>
                    <p>
                        Next we can extract the time history of the Telsa stock market using the Alpha Vantage API by creating a <code>TimeSeries</code> object and using the <code>get_daily</code> method to extract the full time history for Telsa shares.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
						<code>ts = TimeSeries(key , output_format='pandas')
df_stock , meta = ts.get_daily(symbol='TSLA',outputsize='full')</code>
					</pre>
                    <p>
                        Now we're ready to see our what our sentiment analysis looks like alongside the Telsa stock!
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Looks like this is clearly not a simple task! Just visually we can see that the sentiment from sampled #elonmusk tweets is incredibly varied which is mostly likely due to the inclusion of noise from the broad net we cast. We can specifically see this
                        from the error bands which show the 95% confidence interval for each sentiment scores, which are consistently wide throughout the 30 day period. The language is in general fairly neutral from the sample, but more positive than
                        negative and stays fairly consistent thoughout. Although it's plausible to assume that the public sentiment would remain consistent over a period of a month, we cannot conclude this with certainty without additional work on understanding
                        what we consider the ground truth to be on public perception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, interestingly, a study on the correlation between twitter sentiment analysis and approval ratings across the 4 years of the Trump presidency found no correlation between the two methodologies in gauging public sentiment. The paper can be found
                        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9475935">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Now looking at Elon Musk's Tweets and replies</b>, we can see a more varied sentiment although his language still measures somewhat neutral as would be expected when on a public platform. However, his subjectivity scores are
                        much more varied and are much more likely to impact public perceptions or confidence, in-turn, potentially impacting Telsa stock. Hopefully I will revisit this in the future!
                    </p>
